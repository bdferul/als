# Use of Language Assignment
| Hinderance | Definition | Descrition | Critical Thinking Tip |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Emotive Content | Using the subject's feelings to bias them positively or negatively. | Naming detergents “Joy” and “Cheer” (positive), not “Dreary” and “Tedious” (negative). The military using the phrase “neutralizing the opposition” (less negative) rather than “killing” (negative). | Recognize when an argument hs made you feel a certain way, and whether or not that feeling is actually an assessment of the facts. |
| Meaningless Comparison | Attempting to tell the subject that their thing is better without having any detail on how it's better or even what it's better than | An ad that claims a battery lasts “up to” 30% longer, but does not say it will last 30% longer, and if it did, longer than what. | Analyze what actually makes a product better or worse, especially for your specific use case. |
| False Implications | Language that is clear and accurate but misleading because it suggests something false | The dairy industry cleverly expresses fat content as a percentage of weight, not of calories. Thus 2% “low” fat milk really has 31% fat when fat is measured as a percentage of calories. | Focus more on the accuracy; clearly state the truth, don't sugar coat it. Don't take things at face value |  
| Doublespeak Jargon | The use of technical language to make the simple seem complex, the trivial seem profound, or the insignificant seem important, all done intentionally to impress others | Referring to a family as “a bounded plurality of role-playing individuals” or a homeless person as a “non-goal oriented member of society.” | Exclude redundant phrases that do not contribute to the narrative. (Working smarter, not harder; leave out the fluff) |
| Assuring Expressions | Implying what you're arguing is common knowledge. | Expressions such as “As everyone knows…”, and “Common sense tells us that…” | Recognize that something being "commmon knowledge" does not make it  |
| Ambiguity | A word or expression that can be understood in more than one way | From the statement “Lying expert testified as trial”, is the expert a liar or is the person an expert on telling when someone is lying? | Don't assume meaning from a poorly constructed sentence. Don't be afraid to ask for clarification |

# Who in my life is a "Well Cultivated thinker"?
My friend Riley. Maybe I misunderstood the question but my interpretation of the term "well cultivated thinker" is someone who is constantly trying to challenge their own viewpoint. Riley is one friend who I feel like I could have any kind of a conversation with. He has very strong biasies but is very aware of them. He will willingly engage in conversations with people who know way more than him, and also way less.
