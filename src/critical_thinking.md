## Arguments

### The Structure of an Argument

Consider the following sentence.
> "The Loki show is meaningless trash because it has no respect for Loki as a character"

This is an example of an argument, or a claim supported by a reason. It can be broken down into the following catagories.

- Claim: `The Loki show is meaningless trash...`
- Indicator: `...because...`
- Reason: `...it has no respect for Loki as a character`

When breaking down an argument, it can be useful to attempt to discern the different types of reasons.
- Deductive: If one thing follows necessarily from another.
- Inductive: If one thing may follow from another if there is strong reason for it to follow.

An example of deductive reasoning would be: `"All bachelors are unmarried. John is a bachelor so he must be unmarried"`

Deductive reasoning is not always so straightforward. If the sentence were structured differently to say `"All bachelors are unmarried. John is unmarried so he must be a bachelor"` this would not necessarily be a deductive statement. We know that `"all bachelors are unmarried"` but, ignoring all outside knowledge, we don't know that `"all unmarried men are bachelors"`. Point 'B' does not logically follow point 'A'. That is the same as saying `"All oranges are fruit, so this apple must be an orange"`.

Inductive reasoning is not so black and white. This is the type of reasoning used by lawyers in the court room
